I am a final-year PhD candidate in the [Decision, Risk and Operations Division](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations) of the [Graduate School of Business](https://home.gsb.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I am advised by Professor [Omar Besbes](http://www.columbia.edu/~ob2105/) and Professor [Will Ma](http://www.columbia.edu/~wm2428/). Prior to joining Columbia, I earned a BS and MS in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (Paris).

The goal of my research is to bridge the gap between the theory and the practice of data-driven decision-making by developing methodological tools tailored to the problem
at hand and by deriving fine-grained and problem-specific guarantees for algorithms. My current research draws on tools from Optimization, Probability and Statistical Learning and is applied to central operational decision-making processes such as those for inventory, pricing and assortment optimization.
