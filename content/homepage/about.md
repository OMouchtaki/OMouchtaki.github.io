I am an Assistant Professor of Technology, Operations and Statistics at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University.
I received my Ph.D. in Operations Research from the Decision, Risk and Operations Division at Columbia Business School where I was advised by Prof. Omar Besbes and Prof. Will Ma. Prior to Columbia, I earned a BS and MS in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Ecole Polytechnique (Paris).

The goal of my research is to bridge the gap between the theory and the practice of data-driven decision-making by developing methodological tools tailored to the problem
at hand and by deriving fine-grained and problem-specific guarantees for algorithms. My current research draws on tools from Optimization, Probability and Statistical Learning and is applied to central operational decision-making processes such as those for inventory, pricing and assortment optimization.
